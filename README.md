# LS-rPPG
We propose a low-light stable self-supervised remote physiological measurement framework (LS-rPPG). Our framework begins with the Adaptive Video Enhancement Module (ADEM), specifically designed for rPPG analysis to enhance video brightness while preserving rPPG signals. Subsequently, we introduce the Low-Light Stable spatiotemporal network (LS-Phys), which focuses on high-frequency information to mitigate noise in low-light conditions. Finally, we propose a novel highest-peak priority learning strategy that enhances feature representation by emphasizing key peak information, improving the robustness of rPPG measurements in low-light environments.
